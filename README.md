# The new beer blog

Idea start: July 10th, 2019

I wanted to make a place where a user can log sour beers that they have tried and also search the closest places that serve sour beers.  

This user would be 21+ and want to see sour beers by the, save beers they try and also save beers that are returned in the search for later referance


### Above was the thought process of this project on day 1...  

User can login and save bars/breweries they have tried, log beers and rate them. They can also search for the closest 9 locations and save them to the beer list. You can also delete them off your saved beer list. Quick and convenient place to track your beers and search for local bars. Unfortonatly, most bars aren't specific to sours so this is more of a general beer tracker as supossed to just sour specific. 



For this project I incorporated:

 * HTML
 * JavaScript
 * CSS
 * Express.js
 * Node.js
 * mongoDB
 * mongoose
 * Reacts.js
 * Yelp API
 * Bootstrap
 * Heroku

For Icebox items I plan on ...

* Incorporating yelp API (check)
* Let user create lists for better organizing of beers and yelp search saves
